# From the Actuator to Self-Driving

Inspired by [From the Transistor](https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor)

Modern autonomous vehicles operate on multiple layers of abstraction, understanding robotics and autonomy from first principles requires building from the fundamentals.

## Topics 

### Section 1: Hardware

- What's an actuator? 
- Basic sensor types.
- How to interface with a robot: hardware communication protocols and wiring

### Section 2: Middleware

- What is ROS?
- Interfacing ROS with hardware and simulating robots using Gazebo

### Section 3: Perception

- Computer Vision
  - Object recognition and detection algorithms: YOLO, SSD, Faster R-CNN
  - Image segmentation: semantic and instance segmentation

### Section 4: Mapping and Localization

- Mapping Techniques 
    - Grid maps
    - Occupancy grids
    - Elevation maps
- What is localization?
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)

### Section 5: Kinematics and Control

- Basic Kinematics from Intro to Physics course
- Control Algorithms
  - Pure Pursuit
  - Linearâ€“quadratic regulator (LQR)
  - Model Predictive Controller (MPC)
  - Reinforcement Learning using DQN [[Paper](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/2016/pdfs/112_Report.pdf)]
  - End-to-end control

### Section 6: Integration
